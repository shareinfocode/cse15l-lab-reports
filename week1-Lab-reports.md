# Lap Report 1

```
# Use command:
    “ls” : To list files
    “cd” : To change a directory
    “pwd” : To see the working directory
    “cat” : To print what’s the content 
```


Question 1 - Using the command with no arguments
---

“pwd” command shows the current working directory. 

By using “pwd” command, we figured out we are on “home” directory, indicated by “/home”

Then, I used “ls” command to see the files on current working directory. 
It shows that we got two directories “lecture1” and “messages”.

There was no error on the output. 

Question 2 - Using the command with a path to a directory as an argument
---

First, I used “pwd” command to see what’s the working directory right now. It shows we are on “/home”.

Second, I used “ls” command so that I could see the list of files on working directory. 

Thirdly, I moved from “home” directory to “lecture 1” by using “cd lecture1” command. 

Then, I checked the working directory by using “pwd” command and it showed that we succefully moved from “home” to “lecture1”.

It causes an error if we try to move to an directory that is not on working directory.

Question 3 - Using the command with a path to a file as an argument

We can execute an file by using “cat” command.
If it’s not an file but directory, it indicates “it’s a directory”.
