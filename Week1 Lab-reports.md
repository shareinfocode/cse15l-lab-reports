“pwd” command shows the current working directory. 

By using “pwd” command, we figured out we are on “home” directory, indicated by “/home”

Then, I used “ls” command to see the files on current working directory. 
It shows that we got two directories “lecture1” and “messages”.

There was no error on the output.

First, I used “pwd” command to see what’s the working directory right now. It shows we are on “/home”.
Second, I used “ls” command so that I could see the list of files on working directory. 
Thirdly, I moved from “home” directory to “lecture 1” by using “cd lecture1” command. 
Then, I checked the working directory by using “pwd” command and it showed that we succefully moved from “home” to “lecture1”.

It causes an error if we try to move to an directory not on working directory.
